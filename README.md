## My Custom Setup

```
version: 1.0.0
collaborator: Ebod Shojaei (Dobes)
```

## Details

Written entirely in Lua, a fun functional programming language, to setup plugins for NeoVim.

Current NeoVim setup with code retyped following tutorials by Josean Martinez (see Acknowledgements).

`lspconfig.lua` was updated to dynamically setup the language servers. Else, all thanks go to Josean Martinez and the wonderful developers in the neovim and lua space.
